# Instrument Lookup System
Authors: Allan Chung

**About:**

This application utilizes SQL to create a database of instruments. Database includes the instrument, its cost and the location. Instruments are stored within this database, and it employs the Model-View-Controller architecture, which separates the application into three interconnected components. When an instrument is queried, the Controller retrieves the relevant data from the Model, which in turn fetches it from the database. This data is then returned to the View, enabling it to present the information to the client effectively.
